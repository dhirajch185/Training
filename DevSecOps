Agile - 
Agile solves problem of lengthy releases (Agile SDLC----->  Evalueate -> Meet -> plan -> Design -> Develop -> Test)
Agile projects have short 2 or 3 weeks sprints for a release.
Agile allows product owenrs to - Define sprint backlogs and dev teams to prioritize the work. So they know what works and what doesn't quickly.
Agile solves Development & testing issues. (in waterfall, the three areas of dev, test and operations are run by different groups)

Agile need to also focus on non-development activities. like building servers patching and networking. Agile didnt touch operations.

Devops - 
Devops brings the three towers of dev test and ops groups together.
There is only one team which performs all the functions in devops.

Agile is the development methodology and Devops is a culture shift. its a way of thinking about an overall application lifecycle.

Devops teams are more involved in security now. They are compliance focussed.

Normal Security Scan: (Typically 1 or 2 weeks task done by a separate security testing team)
Develop code -> Send code to security -> Scan code -> Send Pdf results -> Find false positives -> Fix security Defects.
Too slow for Devops model

Key Questions to address in Devops
1) How to perform all the testing quickly? Time matters in Devops world
2) Who is responsible for secuirty in Devops? Secuirty team or Dev team

Focus on 3 Key things:
1) Automation
2) Education
3) Empowerment of dev team

DevSecOps -
Merging of secuirty into Devops process
Give dev team more ownership & accountability
Integrate automated security in every step of process

Automation is key to devSecOps.
Static scans which takes hours wont work anymore.
What tools can we use??
Put something is script, have it run in background and push results to the developers. Into a tool which dev teams use.
something like Jira or Quality center which they regularly use.
One step further would be results should be through chats like slack or some other immediate notification mechanism so dev can act on the results quicker. not PDFs.

Education:
Dev team need to know secuirty basics.
