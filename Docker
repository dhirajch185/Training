docker ps (list containers which are actively running)

docker ps --all (lists all containers which docker knows)

docker logs conatinername/ID (logs for troubleshooting applications) tip-- first few characters of the container ID should still show the container

without logs command, we can use another way like - "docker container start --attach containerID" (will attach a terminal to the container container to show the logs)

docker run hello-world:linux ( creates a container from 'hello-world' image, stated it and attached terminal to show log)

docker run = docker container create + docker container start + docker container attach

Exit Code =0 means the the container created with the correct entrypoint.

docker rm containerID (delete the container)
