kubectl get pods
kubectl get pods -o wide
kubectl describe pod <podname>
kubectl create -f <podcreation.yaml filename> ---------- Delcarative Way
kubectl run mynginx_podname --image=nginx_dockerHubImageName ---- imperative way
kubectl describe pod <pod_name> | grep -c "Containers:"  ---------> to find the number of containers used in the pod
kubectl create -f .\rc-definition.yaml (Create replication Controller)
kubectl delete rc myapp-rc ----- Delete replication controller
kubectl get replicaset
kubectl replace -f replicaset-definition.yaml ( will replace the existing replicaset with any new changes) --- Declarative way
kubectl replace --force -f pod-definition.yaml ( will delete and recreate the pod)

************ your linux version?? ---->  cat /etc/*release*


kubectl scale --replicas=6 -f replicaset-definition.yaml -- Imperative way
kubectl scale --replicas=6 replicaset myapp-replicaset --- Imperative way with type & name format
kubectl edit replicaset myapp-replicaset ------------ Risky.. Imperative way to make changes to the replicaset. Note: Careful.. Saving the edited file will immediately apply the changes.
kubectl delete replicaset myapp-replicaset -- Delete replicaset
kubectl create -f deployment-definition.yaml
kubectl create deployment --image=nginx nginx
kubectl create deployment --image=nginx nginx --dry-run=client -o yaml > nginx-deployment.yaml  ---------> Generate Deployment YAML file (-o yaml). Don’t create it(–dry-run)

kubectl create deployment --replicas=3 --image=httpd:2.4-alpine httpd-frontend --dry-run=client -o yaml > httpd-deployment-definition.yaml  ----> created a file as required

kubectl create deployment --image=nginx nginx --replicas=4 --dry-run=client -o yaml > nginx-deployment.yaml  -----> deployment yaml file with replicas as needed

kubectl get deployments
kubectl get all  ----------------- Shows all the resources created
kubectl get pods,svc ----------------- Shows just pods and services created
kubectl get pods --watch ----------- will show the status of the pods continuously if it changes.
kubectl rollout status deployment/myapp-deployment
kubectl apply -f deployment-definition.yaml  ----------- Make changes to the deployment yaml (like image version) and upgrade
kubectl set image deployment/myapp-deployment \ nginx-container=nginx:1.9.1 ------- upgrading imperatively using container name (only for toubelshooting)

kubectl rollout status deployment.apps/myapp-deployment
kubectl rollout history deployment/myapp-deployment
kubectl rollout undo deployment/myapp-deployment

******** Services nodePort range is -- 30K to 32767 ******
-- service uses random algorithm to distribute load across all the pods which it had identified based on the service definition file labels which matched with pods labels from their definition.
kubectl create -f .\service-definition.yaml
kubectl get services
minikube service myapp-service --url -------------------- to get the url of service running on minikube node

kubectl delete pods --all -n default ------- Deltes all the pods running on the namespace by the name 'default'


---------------------namespace ---------------------

kubectl config set-context $(kubectl config current-context) --namespace=dev  --> Permanently switch to a namespace so no namespace mentioned everytime
kubectl get pods --all-namespaces -----> get pods form all namespaces
------------- Troubleshooting -----------------
After fixing the image name, you can re-deploy the changes using below command
kubectl apply -f podCreate.yaml
         or
kubectl edit pod <podName>
Then check the pod details, you should see the STATUS as running

---------------- Terminologies ---------------
replication controller - create multiple pods or nodes to load balance. (older technology and obsolete)
Replica set - new way of implementation (apiversion : apps/v1, selector mandatory)
Poda - apiVersion is v1
Rolling upgrade.
cillium/flannel - used for internal routing, ip address allocation between nodes and pods in a cluster
NodePort (range 30000 to 32767)
ClusterIP
LoadBalancer


--------------------- Binding for Manual scheduling ---------------
create a 'Binding' object (yaml file) to assign a node name to a existing pod and send a post request to the pod's binding api.
Thus mimicking what the actual scheduler does.

If a scheduler is missing, to assign a node manually to a pod, use the field 'nodeName: node01' to the pod definition to get the job done.

---------------- scenarios -------------
kubectl get pods --selector app=App1     -> filters all the pods with the label selector app=App1
 k get pods --selector bu=finance | wc -l  ---> counts the pods along with header
k get pod --selector env=prod,bu=finance,tier=frontend  --> multiple filters

kubectl get all --selector env=prod --no-headers | wc -l  ------> count without headers

kubectl expose pod redis --port=6379 --name redis-service --------> Create a service redis-service to expose the redis application within the cluster on port 6379.

kubectl run httpd --image=httpd:alpine --port=80 --expose ------> Create a pod called httpd using the image httpd:alpine in the default namespace. Next, create a service of type ClusterIP by the same name (httpd). The target port for the service should be 80. Try to do this with as few steps as possible.


kubectl taint nodes node-name key=value:taint-effect ----> to taint (label) the nodes so pods which do not tolerate (match the labels) the taint will not be placed in the node with the taint value.

Pods which do not tolerate the taint will have 3 response status ---> NoSchedule (pods will not be scheduled on the nodes), PreferNoSchedule (system will try to place the pod on the node but 'no gurantee'), NoExecute (New pods will not be scheduled and any existing pods which do not tolerate the taint will be evicted as well from the node) 

example: kubectl taint nodes node1 app=blue:NoSchedule

Tolerations are added to the pods with tolerations added to spec of the pod yaml defition.
spec:
  tolerations:
    - key: "app"
      operator: "Equal"
      value: "blue"
      effect: "NoSchedule"
*********Note: taint and toleration doesnt mean the tolerated pod always ends up in a tainted node. it can be distributed to untainted node as well. This is just to restrict the specific nodes to have only certain type of pods. To ensure required pods to end up to required nodes, we use a different concept called 'NodeSelector' and 'NodeAffinity' 

kubectl label nodes <node name> <label-key>= <lable-value>  ------> To label a node with 'nodeselctor' property under spec in Pod definition yaml file.
eg: kubecl label nodes node01 size=Large

----------> Run the command: kubectl taint nodes controlplane node-role.kubernetes.io/control-plane:NoSchedule- to untaint the node. ************ Observe the NoSchedule have a '-' at the end to untaint it????

------- Pod lifecycle -- stages
Scheduler places a pod in a node based on these affinity rules
requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoreDuringExecution
preferredDuringScheduingIgnoreDuringExecution

During Scheduing - Pod does not exist and created for the first time
During Execution - This is where the changes is made in the label of the node after the pods are allocated to the node.

Affinity rules are considered and pods are placed on the right nodes when the pods are newly created.
If nodes with matching labels are not available, with requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoreDuringExecution type, the scheduler will mandate that the pod will be placed on a node with given affinity rules. If it cannot find one, the pod will not be scheduled. If placement of pod is crucial, this type will be used. If its not crucial then use preferredDuringScheduingIgnoreDuringExecution, that way it will place it if it cant find the mathing labels.

IgnoreDuringExecution means, already allocated pods doesnt have any change if node lable is made.


preferredDuringScheduingRequiredDuringExecution -- This is when after label change, the pods are evicted from the node if the nodeAffinity rules doesn't match.
--------------------------------------------
kubectl run redis --image=redis --dry-run=client -o yaml > redis-pod.yaml -------->to create a yaml file from 'kubectl run' command is like. Reember --dry-run will not create the resource just the yaml file.

kubectl get replicaset new-replica-set -o yaml > replicaset-definition.yaml

----------------------------------- Expose Vs Service --------------------------------------------

Service
Create a Service named redis-service of type ClusterIP to expose pod redis on port 6379

kubectl expose pod redis --port=6379 --name redis-service --dry-run=client -o yaml
(This will automatically use the pod’s labels as selectors)

Or

kubectl create service clusterip redis --tcp=6379:6379 --dry-run=client -o yaml 
(This will not use the pods labels as selectors, instead, it will assume selectors as app=redis.

You cannot pass in selectors as an option.

So, it does not work very well if your pod has a different label set. So, generate the file and modify the selectors before creating the service)

Create a Service named nginx of type NodePort to expose pod nginx’s port 80 on port 30080 on the nodes:

kubectl expose pod nginx --type=NodePort --port=80 --name=nginx-service --dry-run=client -o yaml
(This will automatically use the pod’s labels as selectors, but you cannot specify the node port. You have to generate a definition file and then add the node port manually before creating the service with the pod.)

Or

kubectl create service nodeport nginx --tcp=80:80 --node-port=30080 --dry-run=client -o yaml
(This will not use the pod labels as selectors.)

Both the above commands have their own challenges. While one of them cannot accept a selector, the other cannot accept a node port. I would recommend going with the

kubectl expose
command. If you need to specify a node port, generate a definition file using the same command and manually input the nodeport before creating the service.


************ kubectl apply (Declarative way) *****************
Kubernetes nomally takes local config file (stored on our local system),  a live object definition (stored in kubernetes memory)..  on kubernetes and 'last applied configuration'(stored in Live ojbect configuration as an 'annotation' ) before deciding what changes to be made.
If the object doesn't exist, an object is created.
Ideally, an object similar to what we had defined locally is created within kubernetes, but also with additional fields to store status of the object. This is the Live object configuration of the object in kubernetes cluster.
when we do kubectl apply, it does a bit more... the yaml of the local is converted to a json format and then stored as 'last applied configuration' 
For any upgrades, all three objects are compared to understand what changes are to be made to the live object.
If any field is removed from local configuration, the 'last applied config' helps to identify the removed fields and 'live object configuration' is upgraded accordingly.
Note This is only done with kubectl apply(declarative) not 'kubectl create'(imperative) or 'kubectl replace'. They don't store 'last applied configuration' like this.

*********************************************** Static Pod Path ****************
static pods will have nodename appended to them.
another way is to look at its yaml definition and check its 'OwnerReference'. if its a 'replicaSet' then its not a staic pod. if ownerReference is a 'node' its a static pod.


What is the path of the directory holding the static pod definition files? --> Run the command ps -aux | grep kubelet and identify the config file - --config=/var/lib/kubelet/config.yaml. Then check in the config file for staticPodPath. --> found this --config=/var/lib/kubelet/config.yaml --> now do this --> cat /var/lib/kubelet/config.yaml | grep 'staticPodPath'
output is --> staticPodPath: /etc/kubernetes/manifests


ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver | grep admission-plugins -------> Since the kube-apiserver is running as pod you can check the process to see enabled and disabled plugins.

Another way is
kubectl get pods -n kube-system.. get details of kubeapiserver. Then grep using the command
kubectl exec -it kube-apiserver-controlplane -n kube-system --kube-apiserver -h | grep 'enable-admission-plugins'


**************************** webhooks ****************

Create TLS secret webhook-server-tls for secure webhook communication in webhook-demo namespace.

We have already created below cert and key for webhook server which should be used to create secret.

Certificate : /root/keys/webhook-server-tls.crt

Key : /root/keys/webhook-server-tls.key


--> kubectl -n webhook-demo create secret tls webhook-server-tls \
    --cert "/root/keys/webhook-server-tls.crt" \
    --key "/root/keys/webhook-server-tls.key"

************************** Check secuirty context of the pod ******************

controlplane ~ ➜  k get pod pod-with-defaults -o yaml | grep -A2 "securityContext"

    runAsNonRoot: true
    runAsUser: 1234

*************************************************************************

# user, but we explicitly request a user id of 0 (root).
# Without the webhook, the pod could be created, but would be unable to launch
# due to an unenforceable security context leading to it being stuck in a
# 'CreateContainerConfigError' status. With the webhook, the creation of
# the pod is outright rejected.

------------------------------------------------------------  VPA autoscaler ---------------------------------------------
We have prepared the required YAML files for you to deploy the Vertical Pod Autoscaler (VPA). Simply follow the steps below to apply the necessary configurations:

Step 1: Install VPA Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs)  <<-----------------------------
These CRDs allow Kubernetes to recognize the custom resources that VPA uses to function properly. To install them, run this command:

kubectl apply -f /root/vpa-crds.yml

Step 2: Install VPA Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)   <<---------------------------
RBAC ensures that VPA has the appropriate permissions to operate within your Kubernetes cluster. To install the RBAC settings, run:

kubectl apply -f /root/vpa-rbac.yml

By running these commands, the VPA will be successfully deployed to your cluster, ready to manage and adjust your pod resources dynamically.
------------------------------------------

Clone the VPA Repository and Set Up the Vertical Pod Autoscaler
You are required to clone the Kubernetes Autoscaler repository into the /root directory and set up the Vertical Pod Autoscaler (VPA) by running the provided script.

Steps:
Clone the repository:

First, navigate to the /root directory and clone the repository:

  git clone https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler.git

Navigate to the Vertical Pod Autoscaler directory:

After cloning, move into the vertical-pod-autoscaler directory:

   cd autoscaler/vertical-pod-autoscaler

Run the setup script:

Execute the provided script to deploy the Vertical Pod Autoscaler:

   ./hack/vpa-up.sh

By following these steps, the Vertical Pod Autoscaler will be installed and ready to manage pod resources in your Kubernetes cluster.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Which of the following are the VPA CRDs that get installed as part of the Vertical Pod Autoscaler setup? --> kubectl get crds | grep verticalpodautoscaler

check Custom Resource Definitions (CRD) --> kubectl get crd

--------------------
VPA deployments in kube-system namespace

k get deploy -n kube-system | grep vpa-*
vpa-admission-controller   1/1     1            1           3m53s
vpa-recommender            1/1     1            1           3m54s
vpa-updater                1/1     1            1           3m54s

check logs for vpa updater -------> k -n kube-system logs vpa-updater-pod_name 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Drain the nodes from a specific node so the pods can be recreated on another node. The node will be cordoned(marked unschedulable). to make them schedulable again, we need to uncordon.

kubectl drain node01

kubectl uncordon node01

kubectl cordon node02 ---> will just mark the node unschedulable but doesn't drain the pods off the node.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------- upgrade clusters --------------------------

To check latest version of components and plan for upgrade using kubeadm tool ---------> kubeadm upgrade plan

Always upgrade controlplane first. Drain all the pods from the controlplane before updating it.

To upgrade Kubernetes version

To seamlessly transition from Kubernetes v1.31 to v1.32 and gain access to the packages specific to the desired Kubernetes minor version, follow these essential steps during the upgrade process. This ensures that your environment is appropriately configured and aligned with the features and improvements introduced in Kubernetes v1.32.

On the controlplane node:

Use any text editor you prefer to open the file that defines the Kubernetes apt repository.

vim /etc/apt/sources.list.d/kubernetes.list
Update the version in the URL to the next available minor release, i.e v1.32.

deb [signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/kubernetes-apt-keyring.gpg] https://pkgs.k8s.io/core:/stable:/v1.32/deb/ /
After making changes, save the file and exit from your text editor. Proceed with the next instruction.

apt update

apt-cache madison kubeadm
Based on the version information displayed by apt-cache madison, it indicates that for Kubernetes version 1.32.0, the available package version is 1.32.0-1.1. Therefore, to install kubeadm for Kubernetes v1.32.0, use the following command:

apt-get install kubeadm=1.32.0-1.1
Run the following command to upgrade the Kubernetes cluster.

kubeadm upgrade plan v1.32.0

kubeadm upgrade apply v1.32.0
Note that the above steps can take a few minutes to complete.

Now, upgrade the Kubelet version. Also, mark the node (in this case, the "controlplane" node) as schedulable.

apt-get install kubelet=1.32.0-1.1
Run the following commands to refresh the systemd configuration and apply changes to the Kubelet service:

systemctl daemon-reload

systemctl restart kubelet

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you are on the controlplane node, run ----------->> ssh node01 to log in to the node01.
